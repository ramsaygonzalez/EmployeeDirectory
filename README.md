<h1 align="center">Welcome to HW-19 Employee Directory ðŸ‘‹</h1>

> This is a ReactJS application that utilzes Axios to pull data from an API to populate a table with employee data.  The application should be able to sort the table and search through the list.

*** Successfully pulled the data from the API and rendered it on a table but was unable to get the search field to work or implement sorting on the table.  This will be achomplished in future development.***
